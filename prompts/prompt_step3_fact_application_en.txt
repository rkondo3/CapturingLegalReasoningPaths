"""Below, facts and legal application sentences are given.
Only those that meet the following conditions should be identified as "Legal Application," and the corresponding facts must be clearly indicated in JSON:
- Based on an explicit legal norm (laws, cabinet orders, ministerial ordinances, municipal ordinances, etc.)
- Render a legal evaluation such as lawful/unlawful with respect to specific facts

The following types of sentences do not constitute legal application. Do not link them to any facts; instead, return an empty list []:
- Sentences that merely state consistency with technical guidelines or standards
- Sentences that only evaluate a party's assertions, such as "the claim has no grounds"
- Sentences that summarize or organize facts without any legal evaluation
- Sentences that explain only the legal provisions or analytical framework that serve merely as a premise for legal application (no evaluation is made)
- Sentences that merely describe the course of administrative procedures (such as council approval or plan changes) without making any evaluation such as "lawful"

The output must be restricted to the following format:
json
{
  "Application1": [corresponding fact number (e.g., "Fact 25")],
  "Application2": []
}

Facts:
%s

Legal Application:
